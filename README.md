An Arduino shield for larsskj-003 boards
========================================

### larsskj-006

This is an Arduino shield that can be used to control my larsskj-003 boards. It includes a TLC 5940 LED driver that is compatible with the standard Arduino library. This board compliments my larsskj-005 board: While the other board can be used for a quick LED test without programming, this board requires programming, but enables proper settings of light power.

The shield is powered by a 7805 regulator and should be connected to a DC power supply of 9-30 volt. The shield works as a power supply for the attached Arduino as well.
